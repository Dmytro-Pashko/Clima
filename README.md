## Clima App
Clima is a well-designed simple weather app that was implemented in a part of the Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart (https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

The Clima app can display information about the weather for the current user's location or any city.
The app uses OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/current) in order to obtain weather information.

## App Desing
Generally, the main focus during the development was aimed at the design of the application.
Clima app contains cozy vector icons designed especially for this app by myself in order to support any type of resolution.
