## Clima App
Clima is a well-designed simple weather app that was implemented in a part of the Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart (https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

The Clima app can display information about the weather for the current user's location or any city.
The app uses c (https://openweathermap.org/current) in order to obtain weather information.

The Clima app handles different errors like missing GPS data, unstable internet connection, and failed communication with OpenWeatherMap API.

## App Desing
Generally, the main focus during the development was aimed at the design of the application.
Clima app contains cozy vector icons designed especially for this app by myself in order to support any type of resolution.
